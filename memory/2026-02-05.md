## Milestones
- **Feishu File Download**: Successfully bypassed plugin limitations to download files from Feishu.
  - Method: Custom Node.js script (`download_feishu_v2.js`) using `tenant_access_token`.
  - Key finding: Needed to iterate through recent messages in the specific chat ID to find the resource `message_id` before downloading.
  - Outcome: Saved `Student life in Deggendorf.pdf` locally.

## Skill Development
- **Office Wizard**: Building a local document parser (`tools/office-wizard`).
  - Status: ✅ Working! PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX all functional.
  - Fixed: `pdf-parse` version conflict (1.1.1 vs 2.4.5 from `office-text-extractor`).
    - Solution: Direct require of `./node_modules/pdf-parse/lib/pdf-parse.js` to force v1.1.1.
  - First successful test: Extracted "Student life in Deggendorf.pdf" content.

## Knowledge Ingestion
- **Grok API**: Received detailed documentation on using Grok for real-time search (Queued #2).
  - Key takeaway: Use `web_search` and `x_search` tools with `grok-4-1-fast` for agentic search.

## Infrastructure
- **Channel Plugin**: Switched to `moltbot-channel-feishu`.
- **Security**: Noted critical warnings about open group policies; planned to restrict `groupPolicy` to `allowlist`.
