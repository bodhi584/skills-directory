# 2026-02-06

## Memory Issue Investigation
- **Problem**: Lost conversation history from this morning after memory restore operation
- **Root Cause**: Memory restore from `seo-business` backup only contained files up to 2026-02-05, missing today's (2026-02-06) conversation logs
- **Missing File**: `/home/hetzner_server/.openclaw/workspace/memory/2026-02-06.md` was not created at start of day
- **Impact**: Conversation history from morning session was not persisted, causing "amnesia" when memory was restored

## Fix Applied
- Created missing `2026-02-06.md` daily log file
- Will document all subsequent conversations and work in this file

## Lessons Learned
- Daily memory files must be created at the start of each day
- Memory restore operations should preserve current day's ongoing work
- Need to implement better memory state management during restore operations
