# What Are AI Agent Skills? A Complete Guide for 2025

> *发布时间: 2026-02-01*

## The Rise of AI Agents

2025 marks the year when AI agents finally broke free from the lab and entered production. With platforms like Claude Code, Cursor, Google Antigravity, and Gemini CLI leading the charge, we're witnessing a fundamental shift in how we interact with AI.

But here's the problem: **A raw AI model is like a brilliant mind without tools.** It can think, reason, and generate text—but it can't execute real-world tasks without additional capabilities.

Enter **AI Agent Skills**.

## What Are AI Agent Skills?

Think of skills as **modular capability packages** that transform a general-purpose AI into a specialized worker.

### Analogy Time 🧠

```
Traditional AI = A very smart consultant who gives advice
AI with Skills = That same consultant + a toolbox + a laptop + access to your systems
```

### Technical Definition

A skill is a structured package containing:
- **System prompts** that define the skill's personality and approach
- **Tools/APIs** the AI can call
- **Examples** and context for better performance
- **Configuration files** for customization
